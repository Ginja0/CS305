# CS305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

Artemis Finacial was a client and they working looking for a secure way for long term storage. They wanted a hash method that was secure for storage. What I did particularly well was recommend SHA-256 hash algorithm which is great at protecting in Java base software. Since the storage was recommended to be stored on site this hash algorithm would be the best. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

Working through the vulnerability assement was challenging and helpful. Since there are false positives that come up it makes it challenging but since it shows the security risk it is more than helpful. It helps the software developer discover security issues in their system that would go unnoticed otherwise. To fix the code I applied simple code to make sure as to not add any vulnerabilities. The most helpful tool was the vulnerability asssement tool. This helped refactor the code and update dependcies to have the code secure. 
From this assignment I would like the employer to know that I have learned how to determine insecure code. I have learned what insecure code is and the common faults. That dependencies also provide security risk and everything should be up to date to prevent attacks on known security faults.
